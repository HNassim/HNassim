## Hey, it's Nassim 👋

I'm a Data engineer who leads technical teams to build data stacks and AI products. 🙂

I've built multiple 0 to 1 systems and products working with diverse teams, tools and
constraints. 

Optimizing for fast execution and solving real problems with
pragmatic solutions.

Optimist, there's never been a better time to live! 😃
